For this project, I took a 2017 Pew Research poll and displayed relevant results in a Shiny app. This app will display favorability ratings for each political party as well as some of the political leaders of the U.S. at the time. This app also provides the opportunity for the user to subset the data based on certain chosen demographic variables such as age and sex.
